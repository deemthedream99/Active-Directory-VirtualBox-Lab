# Active Directory Homelab Setup ðŸš€

## Overview
This homelab demonstrates my experience setting up an Active Directory environment on Windows Server 2022.

## Components
- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 VM (Domain-joined client)
- VirtualBox as the hypervisor

## Steps Taken
1. Installed Windows Server 2022 and configured Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
2. Created a domain (e.g., lab.local).
3. Added a Windows 10 VM and joined it to the domain.
4. Created and managed users, groups, and permissions.
5. Verified setup using PowerShell and Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC).
